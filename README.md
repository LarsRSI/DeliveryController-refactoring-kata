Delivery Kata
===================================

Ronnie prides himself on being a quick developer and has been able to get out the first version
of our software in record time. But Ronnie has left to go to a better paying job.
The developer we replaced him with has told us they're too afraid to make any changes we need without
having some tests around the old code before they start changing it.

Many customers would prefer to get notified by SMS, or even through this new messenger app.

Sadly they don't have enough experience to write tests of their own.
Our stakeholders are getting anxious that they've not seen any new features for quite some time now.
They miss Ronnie's productivity.

We'd like you to help us with

* writing tests so that our developer can get quick feedback about the changes they make
* fix any bugs you encounter,
* implement the missing functionality: 
sending SMS in case we not only have an email address but also have a phone number associated with a delivery. 


The feature after that, notifications through the new messenger app, will be handled by our developer then.
